# Ansible Collection - thulium_drake.roles

This collection contains all roles I currently have published on Galaxy/Github.

This collection does _NOT_ follow a semantic versioning scheme, instead it is versioned like this:

```
YEAR.WEEK.RELEASE
```

Where RELEASE starts at 0. All the roles contained in the collection are versioned themselves
and their versions can be found [here](../VERSIONS.md)

## Contents
Apart from all the roles I have published, this collection also includes the excellent ansible-merge-vars from https://github.com/leapfrogonline/ansible-merge-vars

The reason it's included here, is because a lot of roles I used, use this plugin
