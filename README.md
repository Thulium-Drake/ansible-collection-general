# Ansible Collection - thulium_drake.roles

This collection contains all roles I currently have published on Galaxy/Github.

This collection does _NOT_ follow a semantic versioning scheme, instead it is versioned like this:

```
YEAR.WEEK.RELEASE
```

Where RELEASE starts at 0. All the roles contained in the collection are versioned themselves
and their versions can be found [here](../VERSIONS.md)
