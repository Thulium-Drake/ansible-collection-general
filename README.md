# Ansible Collection - thulium_drake.general

This collection contains all roles I currently have published on Galaxy/Github.

This collection does _NOT_ follow a semantic versioning scheme, instead it is versioned like this:

```
YEAR.WEEK.RELEASE
```

Where RELEASE starts at 0. All the roles contained in the collection are versioned themselves
and their versions can be found [here](../VERSIONS.md)

## Contents
Apart from all the roles I have published, this collection also includes the excellent ansible-merge-vars from https://github.com/leapfrogonline/ansible-merge-vars

The reason it's included here, is because a lot of roles I used, use this plugin

NOTE: The repo itself does not contain any roles, they are mirrored on my Github account. You can find them here: https://github.com/Thulium-Drake?language=&page=1&q=ansible-role&sort=name&tab=repositories&type=public (not the forked ones :-) )
